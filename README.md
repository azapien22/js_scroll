js_scroll
=========

Exercise for the CodingDojo's Javascript course.  See the learning platform to see how you should improve the codes.  There are several bugs with the codes which are intentional. :)

Please work on the following features after you go through the codes and understand what's happening.
There is a bug where the last character in the word doesn't show up! Please fix this error.
There is a bug where the spaces in the words do not appear correctly. For example, for the word "being helpful". After showing "being", the space should make the right border/cursor move a little bit to the right (to account for the space being entered by the user) yet it doesn't work correctly. Please fix this error. (Hint: It may be easier to see if you slow the interval down)
// Hint: You may want to use the code below to represent space
// DON'T FORGET TO ADD "&" SYMBOL BEFORE IT
nbsp;
  
Make your own modifications and have fun with it :)
